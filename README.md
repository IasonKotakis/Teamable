# Teamable
A demo project that utilizes HTML, CSS, JS, VueJS, MongoDB, and automated tests with Jest. It will be deployed through a Linux Server on Cloud, configured for multi environment deployment while keeping version control with Git. For project management I have used JIRA for optimal SDLC cycles.
